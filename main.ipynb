    "## Overview:\n",
    "The daily To-Do list is an app that keeps track of your daily tasks. Upon entering the app, you can start adding tasks to your daily list which get reset after 24hrs. Tasks can be added and deleted in between as well. Upon completing all the tasks you will get a congratulations (with sfx) message that will keep you motivated to maintain the streak of completing your daily tasks. You can add previous day's tasks with the click of a single button."
